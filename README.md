- **[`Create_Master_Hydrometric_Dataset/`](Create_Master_Hydrometric_Dataset/)**  
  A *comprehensive* workflow that harmonizes meteorology and streamflow for ET calculations and downstream analyses.

- **[`Discharge_metrics/`](Discharge_metrics/)**  
  Q-based indicators including:
  - **RBI (flashiness)**
  - **Recession curve slope** (log–log slope of −dQ/dt vs. Q)
  - **Dynamic (active) storage** using the storage–discharge (Kirchner–Staudinger) approach

- **[`ET_calculations/`](ET_calculations/)**  
  Evapotranspiration estimation using multiple methods and combined summaries
  
- **[`Plots/`](Plots/)**  
  Scripts to generate figures for exploration and publication.

- **[`Prior_analyses/`](Prior_analyses/)**  
  Archived notebooks/scripts from early project stages (e.g., proposal writing, initial concentration–discharge exploration).

- **[`deprecated/`](deprecated/)**  
  Old or replaced scripts retained for traceability.
